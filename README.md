# BigWigs_Countdown_HeroesOfTheStorm

**This addon is a BigWigs plugin and requires BigWigs to run.**

Adds countdown voices from Heroes of the Storm to BigWigs for all supported locales.

The language is initially set using your locale. You can change the language in the BigWigs options (`/bw`). The default countdown voice is set in "Sounds". You can also enable countdown per ability and change the voice for it in that ability's "Sounds" tab.
